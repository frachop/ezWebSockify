# ezWebsockify

## WebSockets support for any application/server based on TCP

Original idea from [WebSockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify).

Written in C++, using [Boost asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_73_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) and [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog).

Meant to be platform independant ( Windows / Macos / Linux )

**NO SSL support.**
